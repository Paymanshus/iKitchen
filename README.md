## Aim
Our goal with this app is to help remove the boundaries which are faced by the Visually Impaired, specifically during a task as essential as cooking.

## Core Working
Our app uses Object Detection and Recognition in order to help identify the vegetables, fruits and other ingredients and condiments which can be found around the common kitchen environment. Further, this is used to create an Inventory System for the user, so that they can not only keep a track of the items in their kitchen, but also get descriptions, recipes etc for the same
